    <h1>Programming!</h1>
    <p>Learning to program had always been a passion of mine, so I went to school for it! I've got one more year to do towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.</p>

    <p>
        I'm including personal and college projects here. I'm NOT
        including games I'm working on or have created, as those
        will be under the Games tab. Also - this isn't an 
        exhaustive list, these are just some of my favorites :)

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a group project for my Software Engineering class. 
        Restaurant Finder is a web app meant to help indecisive people
        choose a restaurant near them. It pulls restaurants from Yelp 
        based on a zip code entered by the user, then displays them one 
        by one to allow the user to either thumbs-up or thumbs-down them 
        based on if they'd consider eating there. If the user selects the 
        thumbs-up, the restaurant remains in the list, and if they select
        the thumbs-down button, it is removed. This continues until only 
        one restaurant is left, with the idea being that this is the 
        restaurant that the user will visit. 
    </p>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My contribution to this project was the entire Python backend. 
        I wrote a script to fetch the top 10 restaurants from Yelp based 
        around the user's entered zipcode, pulling the restaurant name, 
        rating, services (such as takeout or outdoor seating), type of 
        food (such as Chinese or Thai), number of reviews, price range, and 
        phone number. To do this, I utilized the Python <i>requests</i> library 
        to submit an HTTP request that would return a JSON object that I could then
        interact with. To allow the frontend of the website to utilize the 
        provided data, I added all of the restaurants and their info to 
        a CSV file that could then be parsed and displayed by the frontend. The 
        GitHub repository for my portion of the project is <a href="https://github.com/SilverAbyss6808/yelp_scraper">here.</a>

    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was a huge learning experience for me, 
        especially since going in, I had only a basic understanding of Python. However, 
        throughout the fourteen hours straight I spent working on this (it ended up being 
        more fun than I expected), I gained a more thorough knowledge of Python. Since the 
        completion of this project, I've gone on to play around more with the language, 
        especially exploring its applications in the field of machine learning. This ended 
        up being my favorite Python project I've ever done :)

    <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a project for a Machine Learning class I took. In this project, I again utilized 
        Python to create a model that could identify poisonous mushrooms with relative accuracy (LEGAL 
        DISCLAIMER: this should not be used to decide whether or not you eat a mushroom you find in your yard. This model 
        is purely for academic purposes. Don't eat that). To find the most effective model for this project, I first tested 
        three different ones on my training dataset of over 60,000 mushroom images - K-nearest-neighbor, support-vector machine, 
        and random forest categorization. The support-vector model took an extremely long time to train and could only come 
        up with an accuracy of 73%, so I threw that one out. The random forest model trained quickly but gave me an accuracy of about 
        99%, which, while that seems good, is actually an indication that it wouldn't perform well on the test data. The 
        K-nearest-neighbor model struck a healthy balance between training time and accuracy (about 90%), so that was the 
        model I ended up using.
