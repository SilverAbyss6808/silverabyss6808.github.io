        Currently, I'm a junior Computer Science major with aspirations to program for 
        a living. My favorite language to work in is Python (time just flies while I'm 
        coding :P) but I'm familiar with <a href="programming.html">several other 
        languages</a>  as well. Throughout my time in college and working as an IT helpdesk 
        technician at both a construction company and at my university, I've learned a lot
        about both working effectively as an individual and as a team (usually with 
        leadership roles), time and scope management, and the importance and maintenance of 
        interpersonal relationships. I'm always open to talk your ear off about computers 
        and their capabilities!
