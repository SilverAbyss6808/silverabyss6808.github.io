    <p>
        Here are some of my favorite games I've made. Again, these are just a few of my favorites, as I 
        just can't list them all here.

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Oh, God.

    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Have you ever tried to program a game in an unfamiliar language using an IDE that is 
        dead-set on making you regret doing so? If so, you might have an idea of about how this project went. This was 
        a group project for my Programming 2 course in which we were instructed to do one thing: program the Oregon 
        Trail in Java using Android Studio.

    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Neko-Sakuba is my current passion project! This game is a 2D top-down farming simulator/RPG that follows 
        the player (a cat!) as they wake up in an unfamiliar land called Nekita. They must venture through the 
        world to try to find out what happened and how to get home. Neko-Sakuba is currently in the beginning 
        stages of development in Godot Engine, which I've found very fun to work in. Though I'm still new to game 
        development, I'm learning a lot and excited to both undertake this journey and finish with a complete 
        game that I can be proud of!
