        Here are some of my favorite games I've made. Again, these are just a few of my favorites (or best learning 
        experiences), as I just can't list them all here.

    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp BlorBoQUEST is a game for a final project for a Mobile App Development class I took in 
        early 2024. This game was a joint effort between me, <a href="https://github.com/PurpleLampShade/">Destiny Morrison</a>, 
        and <a href="https://github.com/DMac-MacDonald">Jane MacDonald</a>, and is a mobile clicker game designed for Android.
        In the game, you play as a man who's been robbed of everything by BlorBo, a purple imp cat god. Your goal is to 
        defeat BlorBo and regain your lost assets. Though initially developed for Android, we have plans to expand to PC 
        using Unity. The repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/SilverAbyss6808/BlorBoQUEST/wiki">here.</a>

    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The gameplay of BlorBoQUEST consists primarily of clicking. You click the button, BlorBo 
        clicks the button. Each time you click it, you regain some money. Each time BlorBo clicks it, he steals it back. Over time, 
        BlorBo starts clicking faster, stealing more of your money. You must purchase upgrades to make your clicking more effective
        so that you can outpace him and take back what's yours. Throughout the game, you receive B-Mails (BlorBo mail), primarily 
        but not exclusively from BlorBo, mocking you, gloating, or warning you of foreclosure. Your future is falling apart. Face 
        BlorBo and take it back!

    <h3 id="oregontrail">The Oregon Trail (Abridged)</h3>
    <img src="assets/oregon.png" alt="oregon trail screenshot">
    <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Oh, God.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Have you ever tried to program a game in an unfamiliar language using an IDE that is 
        dead-set on making you regret doing so? If so, you might have an idea of about how this project went. This was 
        a group project for my Programming 2 course in which we were instructed to do one thing: program the Oregon 
        Trail in Java using Android Studio. Simple, right? Nope. Between the code breaking between computers, the IDE 
        consistently bluescreening a group member's laptop, none of us having much of a programming backgroud at the time, 
        consistent bugs, and so, so much more, this project was a nightmare that we still bring up as a horror story in 
        conversation from time to time. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How'd we overcome this, then? Well... caffeine. Lots of caffeine. Besides this, I pulled 
        several all-nighters trying to pull the whole group's code into something coherent - we decided that since the code 
        wouldn't work consistently between our computers, we should have one person pull everything together. I volunteered, 
        and eventually managed to work out a coherent, albeit shortened, version of the game. The whole experience was a 
        valuable lesson in teamwork, deadlines, mediating conflict sparked by stress, and rolling with whatever punches your 
        IDE throws at you. After the completion of this project, I feel leagues more confident in my ability to overcome 
        stressful situations and improvise on a deadline. Also, I never want to see the Oregon Trail again.

    <h3 id="nekosakuba">Neko-Sakuba</h3>
    <img src="assets/catgame.png" alt="screenshot of my game">
    <br>
    <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Neko-Sakuba is my current passion project! This game is a 2D top-down farming simulator/RPG that follows 
        the player (a cat!) as they wake up in an unfamiliar land called Nekita. They must venture through the 
        world to try to find out what happened and how to get home. Neko-Sakuba is currently in the beginning 
        stages of development in Godot Engine, which I've found very fun to work in. All assets are also made 
        by me, though they'll probably see a few more revisions before I'm fully happy with them. Though I'm 
        still new to game development, I'm learning a lot and excited to both undertake this journey and finish 
        with a complete game that I can be proud of!
